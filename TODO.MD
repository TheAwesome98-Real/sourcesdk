# To do
## In order of importance:
- [X] Fix build on Linux (sp: missing maths symbols, mp: thinks we're in a valve chroot)
- [ ] Implement the game directories for mp and sp
- [ ] Find and implement fixes and patches for the SDK
- [ ] Use another build system instead of this weird vpc stuff
- [ ] Major refactor the code
- [ ] Merge MP and SP if possible?
- [ ] Put more engine stuff in here like hammer and gameui
- [ ] x86_64 (and other arch's) support (requires reverse engineering the hl2_*.* executable, something valve won't give us the src for)
